# Treated Municipal Wastewater Dataset
## Dataset Source
The initial dataset – consists of 17 XLSX files representing treated municipal wastewater historical data from 2008 to 2024 - was obtained 
from [https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/municipal-treated-wastewater-effluent](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/municipal-treated-wastewater-effluent). This is a public data source provided by Ministry: Environment, Conservation and Parks (Ontario, Canada).
Some of the original files (in CSV format) are too large for GitHub. Therefore, you can download them from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kZ8xXnKVMvC3uFeiLHynqrmYuU6sivR5)
